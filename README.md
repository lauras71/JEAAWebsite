# JEAA WEBSITE

This repository is for the development, handling and further maintenance of the JEAA website.
The code is written in html, css and javascript.

## Structure
* images folder: all the images needed for the website go here
* script.js: js file needed for the langiage switching throughout the whole website
* lang.json: here we put the texts of the website in the three languages (IT, DE, EN)
* index.html: this is the landing page of the website
All other .html files handle the different pages that can be visualized in the website

## Basic guidelines
* before starting working on the project, please create your own branch in order not to modify directly the main branch
* always give clear and understandable names to files, variables and html classes or ids.
* always comment the code so that other members can understand your work easily
